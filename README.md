# User-Authentication-in-Web-Apps
## We will be dealing with different authentication way to secure Apps


1. Authentication Using Passport-Local strategy
2. Authentication Using Json-Web-Token(JWT)
3. Public Key Cryptography (a.k.a. Asymmetric Cryptography)
4. Authentication Using Json-Web-Token(JWT) + Public Key Cryptography
5. Authentication Using Passport-JWT strategy


#### Each Repo has one Authentication method implemented

### Description

1. Passport-Local strategy

## About Passport-Local Strategy


### What follows is a brief description of each entry, but most Npm library contain their own README.md file with additional documentation, so browse around to learn more.

  *  `PassportJS`- Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express- based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

 * `passport-local-strategy/ `- The local authentication strategy authenticates users using a username and password. The strategy requires a verify callback, which accepts these credentials and calls done providing a user.

 * `ExpressJs/` - Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for Node.js *
